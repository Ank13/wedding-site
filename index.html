      <h3>Planes</h3>
        <p>The most convienent airport is Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD),
          which hosts most major airlines.
        </p>
        <p>If you are a Southwest Airlines frequent flier, then you might consider
          Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW), but it is much
          farther from Highland Park than O'Hare.

      <h3>Trains</h3>
        <p>Chicago's <a href="http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home.html">Metra</a> runs
          between downtown Chicago and Highland Park. Get on at Ogilvie Transportation
          Center (buy tickets in station to avoid surcharge), and get off at
          Ravinia (not <i>Ravinia Park</i>). The ride is approximately 45 minutes
          on a Sunday morning, and one-way ticket costs $5.25. Ravinia station is
          0.7 miles from the synagogue. Either walk, or contact us to arrange a ride.

      <h3>Automobiles</h3>
        <p>
           Rather than paying for cabs to and from the airport, you might consider renting a car during your stay, especially if you’ll be exploring the Chicago area over the weekend.

      <h2>Guide for the Perplexed</h2>
      <h4>Understanding Jewish Wedding Traditions</h4>

      <h5>Kabbalat Panim</h5>
      <p>Shira will be sitting on a chair, symbolizing a throne, as she begins her role as the “queen” for the day. She will be surrounded by the mothers, grandmothers, sisters, and bridemaids. It is customary for guests to greet Shira and rejoice with her.</p>
      <hr>

      <h5>Tisch</h5>
      <p>Avi, the “king” will command his own room where he will be surrounded by the fathers, brothers, and other friends. During this time some important legal and ritual documents will be signed.</p>

      <p>Everyone is encouraged to walk between the two rooms to greet both Shira and Avi. Appetizers will be served during this time.</p>
      <hr>

      <h5>Bedeken</h5>
      <p>At the conclusion of Avi’s tisch, he will be escorted - to the sound of festive music - by the fathers, family, and friends to see Shira. People are encouraged to join in the singing and dancing. Avi performs the bedeken - he “checks” to confirm that the bride is Shira and then will cover her face with her veil. It is also customary for Shira to receive blessings from the fathers at this time.</p>
      <hr>

      <h5>Chuppah</h5>
      <p>The guests will then find their way to the synagogue’s sanctuary for the ceremony. Shira and Avi will be married under a chuppah, which symbolizes the home they will build together. It is open on all four sides to represent their open, welcoming, and hospitable home. The ceremony will be conducted by Shira’s father, Rabbi Vernon Kurtz.</p>
      <hr>

      <h5>Yichud</h5>
      <p>At the conclusion of the ceremony (after Avi breaks the glass), Shira and Avi will leave the chuppah surrounded by friends and family who are singing and dancing to festive music. They are escorted to a private room where they will share their first moments together as a married couple.</p>
      <hr>

      <h5>Simcha (Reception)</h5>
      <p>The guests are invited into the reception hall to begin their first course. After their private time together, Shira and Avi will join their guests in the hall for the celebration, beginning with traditional Jewish music and dancing (hora). It is a great mitzvah to dance before the bride and groom and entertain them. Shira and Avi will rejoice with their guests through dancing and partaking in the wedding feast.</p>
      <hr>

      <h5>Mezinka</h5>
      <p>During the reception, Bryna and Vernon (Shira’s parents) and Carol and Joel (Avi’s parents) will take seats on the dance floor and will be presented with flower crowns by their children. They will be honored in this traditional way for marrying off their last children. Family and friends will circle them with dance and people are encouraged to give each one a kiss and wish them a mazel tov.</p>
