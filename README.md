wedding-site
============

I'm making a fun little static site for my upcoming wedding, and incorporating a few things that I've been wanting to check out:
- using impress.js for story.html
- using foundation css for the layout on index.html (not using the foundation js files yet, might remove)
- might add some mapping tools
